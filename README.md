## üéÆ Game Rules

Here are the default game rules for **Building Sinta**:

- **Starting Health Points (HP)**: Every player begins the game with **3 HP**. 
  - If a tower block is dropped and doesn't stack, **1 HP is deducted**. 
  - The game ends when all HP are depleted.

- **Scoring System**:
  - **Success**: When a block is successfully stacked on top of another, the player is rewarded with **25 points**.
  - **Perfect**: If a block is stacked perfectly aligned with the block below, the player is rewarded with **50 points**.
  - **Combo Bonus**: Consecutive **Perfect** stacks reward an **additional 25 points per combo**. 
    - For example:
      - The first Perfect stack awards **50 points**.
      - The second consecutive Perfect awards **75 points**.
      - The third consecutive Perfect awards **100 points**, and so on.

**Note**: Each Success or Perfect stack is equivalent to building a floor for your tower.
